        <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent('q1')">What is an IP address?</button>
        <div id="q1" class="toggle-content">
          An IP address, short for Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two primary functions: network interface identification and location addressing.

    Each IP address consists of a series of numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.1.1 for IPv4 or 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 for IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length and are typically represented in decimal format, while IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and are represented in hexadecimal format.

    IP addresses enable devices to communicate with each other over a network by providing a means of identifying both the source and destination of data packets. When a device wants to send data to another device, it includes the IP address of the destination device in the packet header. Routers and other network devices then use this information to route the packet to its intended destination across the network.

        <button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q2')">What is a public IP address?</button>
        <div id="q2" class="toggle-content">
           A public IP address is an address that is globally unique and accessible over the internet. It serves as the outward-facing address for devices connected to a network, allowing them to communicate with other devices and services on the internet. Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or network administrators and are unique across the entire internet.

    Unlike private IP addresses, which are used within local networks and are not directly accessible from the internet, public IP addresses are directly reachable from any device connected to the internet. They are used to identify devices such as web servers, email servers, and routers that need to communicate with other devices across the internet.

    Public IP addresses are typically assigned dynamically or statically. Dynamic IP addresses are assigned by ISPs on a temporary basis and may change over time, while static IP addresses remain constant and are often used for services that require a permanent address, such as web hosting or remote access.
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q3')">What is a private IP address?</button>
        <div id="q3" class="toggle-content">
          A private IP address is an address used within a private network and is not accessible from the internet. It is typically assigned to devices connected to a local area network (LAN) or other private networks. Private IP addresses are used for internal communication within a network and are not routed over the internet.

    Unlike public IP addresses, which are globally unique and directly accessible from the internet, private IP addresses are reserved for use within specific private networks. This allows organizations to create their own private addressing schemes without conflicting with public IP addresses.

    There are three ranges of IP addresses designated for private use in IPv4: 
    - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (a single Class A network)
    - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (16 contiguous Class B networks)
    - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (256 contiguous Class C networks)

    Devices within a private network use private IP addresses to communicate with each other, and a router or gateway device is typically used to translate between private and public IP addresses when accessing the internet. This process, known as network address translation (NAT), allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address for internet access.

    Private IP addresses provide security and privacy by isolating internal network traffic from the internet. They are commonly used in homes, businesses, and other organizations to facilitate local network communication while maintaining internet connectivity.
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q4')">What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?</button>
        <div id="q4" class="toggle-content">
            IPv4 and IPv6 are two different versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) that are used to identify and communicate with devices on a network. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 lies in the size of the IP addresses they use and the way they handle network addressing.

    IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the number of possible unique addresses to around 4.3 billion. This limitation has led to the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, especially with the rapid growth of internet-connected devices. IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a significantly larger number of unique addresses—approximately 340 undecillion (3.4 × 10^38). This vast address space ensures that there are more than enough addresses to accommodate the growing number of internet-connected devices.

    Another key difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the way they handle network addressing and packet headers. IPv6 simplifies the packet header format and includes features such as stateless address autoconfiguration, which allows devices to automatically configure their IPv6 addresses without the need for a DHCP server. IPv6 also includes built-in support for features like multicast addressing and flow labeling, which were added as extensions in IPv4.

    Additionally, IPv6 includes improvements in areas such as security, network autoconfiguration, and routing efficiency. It also provides better support for mobile devices and new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT).

    Despite these advantages, the adoption of IPv6 has been relatively slow due to the need for infrastructure upgrades and the compatibility issues with existing IPv4 systems. However, as the depletion of IPv4 addresses becomes more critical, the transition to IPv6 is becoming increasingly necessary to support the continued growth of the internet and ensure the availability of IP addresses for future generations.
        </div>
 <button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q5')">How is an IP address assigned?</button>
<div id="q5" class="toggle-content">
  IP addresses can be assigned to devices in two primary ways: statically (manually) or dynamically (automatically).

    Static IP address assignment involves manually configuring the IP address settings for a device. Network administrators typically assign static IP addresses to devices that require consistent and predictable network configurations, such as servers, network printers, and network infrastructure devices. With static IP addressing, the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server settings are manually configured on each device.

    Dynamic IP address assignment, on the other hand, is done automatically through protocols like DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). DHCP servers are responsible for dynamically assigning IP addresses to devices on a network when they join the network or when their lease for an IP address expires. When a device connects to the network, it sends a DHCP request, and the DHCP server responds by assigning an available IP address from its pool of addresses. The DHCP server also provides other network configuration parameters, such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses, to the requesting device.

    Dynamic IP addressing offers several advantages over static IP addressing, including simplified network management, efficient use of IP address resources, and the ability to accommodate devices that frequently connect and disconnect from the network, such as laptops and mobile devices.

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q6')">What is subnetting in IP networking?</button>
<div id="q6" class="toggle-content">
    Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks. It helps in efficient utilization of IP addresses and reduces network congestion by logically segmenting the network.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q7')">What is IP spoofing and how does it affect network security?</button>
<div id="q7" class="toggle-content">
    IP spoofing is a technique where an attacker impersonates another device by falsifying the source IP address in the packet headers. This can be used to launch various types of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking. It affects network security by allowing attackers to bypass authentication measures, gain unauthorized access to systems, and disrupt network communication.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q8')">What is a loopback IP address?</button>
<div id="q8" class="toggle-content">
    A loopback IP address, often represented as 127.0.0.1 in IPv4, is a special address that points back to the same device. It is used for testing network connectivity on the local system without actually connecting to an external network. Loopback addresses are commonly used for troubleshooting and diagnostic purposes.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q9')">What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and how does it work?</button>
<div id="q9" class="toggle-content">
    DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It works by having a DHCP server manage a pool of IP addresses and lease them to devices on the network for a specific period of time. When a device connects to the network, it sends a DHCP request, and the DHCP server responds with an available IP address and other configuration settings.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q10')">What is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and how does it impact IP addressing?</button>
<div id="q10" class="toggle-content">
    CIDR is a method used to allocate IP addresses and route IP packets more efficiently. It replaces the older class-based addressing scheme with a more flexible system that allows for variable-length subnet masking. CIDR allows for the aggregation of IP addresses into larger blocks, reducing the size of routing tables and improving the efficiency of routing on the Internet.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q11')">What is NAT (Network Address Translation) and why is it used?</button>
<div id="q11" class="toggle-content">
    NAT is a technique used to modify network address information in packet headers while in transit. It is commonly used to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. NAT helps conserve public IP addresses and provides an additional layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q12')">What is a default gateway and its role in IP networking?</button>
<div id="q12" class="toggle-content">
    A default gateway is a device on a network that serves as an access point or "gateway" to other networks. It is typically a router or a firewall that forwards traffic from devices on the local network to destinations outside of the network. The default gateway is responsible for routing packets between different networks and is essential for enabling communication between devices on separate networks.
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q13')">What are the common IP address classes?</button>
<div id="q13" class="toggle-content">
    The common IP address classes are:
    <ul>
        <li>Class A: Addresses in the range 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0, with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0.</li>
        <li>Class B: Addresses in the range 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0, with a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0.</li>
        <li>Class C: Addresses in the range 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0, with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.</li>
        <li>Class D (Multicast): Addresses in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, reserved for multicast groups.</li>
        <li>Class E (Reserved): Addresses in the range 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254, reserved for future use or experimental purposes.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<button class="toggle-button mt-3" onclick="toggleContent('q14')">What is IP forwarding and when is it used?</button>
<div id="q14" class="toggle-content">
    IP forwarding is the process of routing IP packets from one network interface to another. It is used when a device needs to forward packets between different networks or subnets. IP forwarding can be done by routers, switches, and other network devices to ensure that packets reach their intended destinations across complex networks.
